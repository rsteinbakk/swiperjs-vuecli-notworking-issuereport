## Problem:
```
First of all, thanks for creating a great slider component! :) 

Got Swiper JS working in/with Vite (https://vitejs.dev/), so it seems like a specific Vue Cli-problem?

Got a problem using Vue Cli (in both Vue 3 and Vue 2, https://cli.vuejs.org/). Probably because the CLI system looks for index.js in node_modules/swiper/vue and other dependencies-folders, and the folder structure is currently not set up like that. 

Would be great if someone could look at this issue :)
