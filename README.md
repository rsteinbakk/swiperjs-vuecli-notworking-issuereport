## Problem:
```
First of all, thanks for creating a great slider component! :) 

Got Swiper JS working pretty fine in/with Vite (https://vitejs.dev/), so it seems like a specific Vue Cli-problem?

Got an issue using Vue Cli (in both Vue 3 and Vue 2, https://cli.vuejs.org/). It seems like it cant find the css file in the Vue Cli setup:

Error message from Vue Cli:
---------------
This dependency was not found:
* swiper/css in ./node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!./node_modules/babel-loader/lib!./node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!./node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist??ref--0-1!./src/components/ImageSwiper.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js
-----------------

Would be great if someone could look at this issue :)
